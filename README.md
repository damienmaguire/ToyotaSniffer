# ToyotaSniffer

Toyota has devised a comms link between Hybrid ECU and motor controllers that is a mashup of SPI and CANbus.

Others have paved the way with the Lexus GS450. See https://openinverter.org/wiki/ToyotaInverters
The openinverter forum has more information, but not obviously connected to the above link.
Github user @damienmaguire has some interesting data dumps, and very cool hardware to control the Lexus and Auris/Yaris hybrids. (in progress)

On the other side of the world, we have Aqua and Prius C hybrids. I'm building this sniffer to see if the locally available models behave the same or different. Plan is to make that data available.
